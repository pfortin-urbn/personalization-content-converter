# Personalization Content Converter Testing Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive 3-day testing of bidirectional translator service for URBN brands, converting between UO Current Format, Dynamic Yield, and Common Request Format with 100% data fidelity validation across 58 diverse payloads.

## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation & Bug Fixes
**Day 1 - Morning**: Initial translator testing revealed critical data mapping issues
- **Issue**: Missing user attributes (`customer_delivery_pass_mbr`, `customer_non_consent`, `tier_status`)
- **Issue**: Inflexible flags structure preventing custom flags like `noCampaigns`
- **Issue**: Missing cart data preservation
- **Issue**: Missing catalog data and itemAction fields
- **Solution**: Enhanced data structures in `utils/translators.go`:
  - Added missing user attributes to structs
  - Changed `IsEventFlags` from struct to `map[string]interface{}`
  - Added cart field preservation
  - Updated extraction and building methods

### Phase 2: Reverse Translation Fixes
**Day 1 - Afternoon**: Forward translation working, reverse translation issues discovered
- **Issue**: Page type mapping problems (`"Cart"` → `"cart"`, `"home"` mapping)
- **Issue**: Action preservation in reverse direction (`"NavigationView"`, `"CartView"` defaulting to `"Page View"`)
- **Solution**: Fixed bidirectional mappings and action preservation logic

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Brand Testing

#### Extended Anthropologie Deep Testing
**Day 3**: Extended testing with 24 additional Anthropologie payloads covering advanced e-commerce scenarios:
- **Complex URL Filtering**: Multiple query parameters (length, sleeve length, sorting)
- **Quick View Interactions**: Quick View and Close Quick View actions
- **Account Management**: Dashboard, settings, order history, hearted products

- **Search Functionality**: Various search scenarios and result pages

### Phase 4: Advanced Feature Validation

#### Round-Trip Testing Process
For each payload, we performed:
1. **UO→Common Translation**: Convert original payload to common format
